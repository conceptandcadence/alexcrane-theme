And that’s a problem for three reasons: 1) it keeps us dependent on fossil fuels (plastic is made from petroleum), 2) plastic doesn’t biodegrade and 3) plastic is toxic.</p>",

In other words: all the plastic that has ever existed, still exists. Every plastic bottle, every polyester t-shirt, is still in a landfill or floating in the ocean.</p>",
